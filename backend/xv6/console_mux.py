"""Two-byte console command multiplexer for the xv6 machine's serial console.

The kernel console is one serial stream shared with the human, and GINI signals the kernel with
control bytes — of which the whole space is exhausted (every Ctrl-A..Ctrl-Z that the human does not
type is already bound). This multiplexes a fresh command space behind ONE reserved **prefix** byte:
`PREFIX <letter>` is a command, so every future console command has a home without a new byte.

**This module is both sides of the bridge in pure Python.** `Decoder` is the executable spec for the
kernel's `consoleintr` state machine — the C must behave byte-for-byte identically, and its shape
mirrors the existing `gini_ctl_op` / `gini_shidx` digit-entry machines (all of which already run
under `cons.lock`, so the console path is serialised and this single-threaded model is faithful).
`encode()` is the agent side. See `docs/design/xv6-rebuild-batch.md` §11.

**Status: proven, INERT.** Nothing imports this yet. It lands here first (step 1 of the trap-capture
integration) so the protocol is in the tree and under CI before the agent and kernel are wired to
it. `test_console_mux.py` pins it (round-trip, passthrough, self-escape, interleave-abort, and two
fuzzers — 44k prefix-free and 20k interleave-anywhere).

Two safety locks make it robust against a human typing into the same stream:

  1. **PREFIX is a CONTROL byte; a sub-command SELECTOR is a PRINTABLE letter.** A selector that gets
     separated from its prefix by an interleaved keystroke can never fire a single-byte command — a
     bare 'a' is just text.
  2. **ABORT-AND-REPROCESS.** PREFIX followed by anything unrecognised drops the orphaned prefix and
     handles that byte as if the prefix had never come. The human never types PREFIX, so a dropped
     prefix is always noise; a stray interleave costs one abandoned command (the agent retries),
     never a wrong command fired. (This is the discipline the Ctrl-G shadow-index bug lacked.)

#: The prefix. Ctrl-W (0x17), demoted from shadowdump — a rare diagnostic, low-risk to move. Chosen
#: (not a placeholder): NOT Enter/Tab/LF (CR/LF/TAB — the human types those), NOT ESC (0x1b, the
#: lead of arrow/paste sequences), NOT 0x1e/0x1f (the dump-frame delimiters). Shadowdump's new
#: binding is `PREFIX PREFIX` (Ctrl-W Ctrl-W) — see `demoted` on the Decoder.
DEFAULT_PREFIX = 0x17

#: Sub-command selectors are printable letters. Each maps to (name, takes_int_arg):
#:   `PREFIX <sel>`            -> zero-arg command
#:   `PREFIX <sel> <digits>\n` -> command with one integer argument
#:   `PREFIX PREFIX`           -> the prefix byte's demoted original command (self-escape)
#: New console commands are added HERE and given a matching `case` in the kernel — that is the whole
#: point of the prefix: one edit each side, no new byte.
