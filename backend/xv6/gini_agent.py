"""gini-xv6 in-container agent — runs gdb-multiarch against the local QEMU stub (where the
kernel symbols live) and serves the reads as JSON/text over HTTP, so the Mac-side Machine Lab
bridge only makes plain HTTP calls (no gdb or symbols needed on the host).

Endpoints (GET unless noted):
  /snapshot  -> {"registers": <text>, "bt": <text>, "procs": <text>, "ticks": <text>}
  /vm        -> vmprint-format text (running proc's page-table leaf mappings)
  /vmall     -> all user procs' page tables (`VP pid name sz` + `VL pid va pa flags`) for COW view
  /faults    -> live page-fault ring (`FLT pid scause va epc`)
  /traps     -> trap-taxonomy counters + ring (`TC kind name count` + `TR pid kind cause epc tval`)
  /fs        -> {"sb": <text>, "log": <text>}
  /step      (POST) -> break swtch; continue; delete   (advance one context switch)
  /trapcatch (POST) -> freeze the next user trap: CSRs (scause/sepc/stval) + saved user registers
  /control   (POST ?quantum=N | ?policy=N) -> write the kernel knob over gdb

The kernel-side parsing stays on the Mac (already unit-tested); this agent just returns raw
gdb output. It talks to :1234 (gdb stub) and reads proc[] via a small gdb-python walk.

        callers could both send, both wait, and both then read `_last_dump` — and `_dump_seq >
        seq0` only proves that *a* dump arrived, never that it was YOURS. A request for /board
        would come back holding the /procs dump, which parses to nothing, and the OS HUD would
        correctly report "no board support" every other poll while the polls that won the race
        drew a perfect board. The symptom looked like an intermittent kernel; it was two readers
        on one wire.

        WAIT ONLY AS LONG AS IT TAKES.
        ------------------------------
        Serialising would be expensive with the old fixed 0.35 s sleep: the OS HUD alone asks for
        four dumps a poll, which would monopolise the line for 1.4 s and starve the Machine Lab.
        A framed dump normally lands in a few milliseconds, so poll for the sentinel and return
        the moment it arrives, keeping `wait` as a ceiling rather than a cost. Same contract,
        typically an order of magnitude less serial time held.
