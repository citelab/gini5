# **Naming one.** A bump is derived from the newest git TAG, and that is only the right answer while
# the tags are ahead of every package on PyPI. They were not: gini-toolkit was published at 6.0.0
# by hand, before a tag drove it, while the repo's newest tag was v0.1.0. Bumping gave 0.2.0 — which
# uploads fine and then loses, because pip serves the HIGHEST version, so every `pipx install
# gini-toolkit` would have kept getting 6.0.0 and no further 0.x release could ever have won. Say
# the version outright when the derived one would land below what is already published; check with
#     pip index versions gini-toolkit
#
# The version is derived from the git tag by setuptools-scm, for all three packages at once —
# gini-core, gini-toolkit and gini-teaching-center share this repo and share a number. Pushing the
# tag is what publishes: the workflows in .github/workflows fire on `v*`.
#
# The guards exist because each has already cost something:
#
#   dirty tree      setuptools-scm stamps a DIRTY tree as `X.Y.Z+1.dev0` — a pre-release that plain
#                   `pip install` skips. That is how a "published" package became uninstallable.
#   existing tag    PyPI refuses to re-upload a version. Ever. Catching it here costs a second;
#                   catching it after the upload costs a version number.
#   stale images    a release whose container images miss an architecture strands every user on
#                   it — and gBuilder asks for the images of ITS OWN version, so they cannot
#                   upgrade their way out without knowing to. 6.0.0 went out arm64-only.
#   failing tests   a release is the worst time to find out.

# The two halves share a namespace and a release number, and pip will NOT upgrade a dependency that

# bridge died on "cannot import name regions_from_leaves". Fresh installs resolved to the newest
# core and worked, which is exactly why nothing caught it before students did.
#
# They are always published together by this tag, so the floor is always this version. Checked
# rather than remembered: "raise it when you add a domain symbol" is not a rule a person can keep.

An older core beside a newer toolkit fails at IMPORT, not at install, and only on upgrade — pip
leaves a dependency alone when the floor already allows it. Set it to the version being cut:
