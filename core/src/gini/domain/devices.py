"""GINI device / element taxonomy.

A single registry describes every kind of element a user can place on the canvas,
spanning classic computer-networking devices and the new cloud-computing primitives.
This is pure data with no Qt dependency so it can be driven by the UI, the compiler,
the persistence layer, and the AI agent layer alike.

    MACHINES exists because the single most valuable comparison GINI can make was invisible: the

    for "something to run this on" had to look in three places — and never saw that they were
    looking at one family. They are: a container, a container with your image, a cloud VM, a real
    microVM with its own kernel (Kata), and a real kernel on QEMU (xv6). Listed lightest-to-heaviest
    (see PALETTE_RANK), the section itself teaches the isolation/weight tradeoff before the student
    reads a word — and the startup-time stamp and cost meter then make it measurable.
