"""The event vocabulary: which of GINI's signals become chain entries, and as what.

Nothing here senses anything new. gBuilder already emits every fact worth recording — a device
was added, a link was made, the lab ran, a probe returned a verdict — so this module is only the
*translation*, kept pure and away from the bus so it can be tested without Qt.

Three tiers, in ascending order of what they prove:

  1. **construction** — place / remove / connect / disconnect / configure. A connect entry also
     carries `connection_rules.can_connect()`'s teaching reason, which is what lets the narration
     say "connected M1 to S1 — join a LAN" instead of "link-7 created".
  2. **operation** — run / open_console / measure / invoke. Evidence that the thing was used.
  3. **witnessed** — witness / objective. The strongest entries: facts GINI measured on the
     *running* network. A witness cannot be produced by importing a file, because there was no
     running network when the file was made.

Two entry kinds are not translations of a signal but statements about provenance — `load` (a
topology arrived from a file) and `preexisting` (the canvas was not empty when recording started).
They exist so the narration can say plainly where the submitted work came from.

**Deliberately not recorded** (see IGNORED): view and selection churn, which is noise, and
`assistant_message`. Recording help-seeking would push students away from the tutor, which costs
more pedagogically than the provenance is worth.
