"""Chain → a transcript an instructor can skim.

Plain rendering, no model. The chain is the evidence and the narration is only its reading; if a
sentence here cannot be pointed at a specific entry, it does not belong. That is the same
invariant as the mission oracle and the Reasoning Twin: GINI states the facts, a person judges
them. (Phase 2's LLM layer reads this same data — it never replaces it, and it never grades.)

Written for the person marking thirty of these on a Sunday: a header that says whose work this is
and whether it hangs together, a timeline in the student's own vocabulary, and a short verdict
paragraph at the end that names anything the chain cannot account for.
