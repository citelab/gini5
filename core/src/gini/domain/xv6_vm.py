"""xv6 virtual-memory state model — the Memory face's read side.

xv6 on RISC-V uses Sv39 three-level page tables: `satp` points at the root, and a 39-bit virtual
address is split into three 9-bit indices (levels 2/1/0) plus a 12-bit offset. A leaf PTE carries
a physical page number and permission flags V/R/W/X/U. This module models the flattened set of
leaf mappings, the process address-space regions (text/data/heap/guard/stack/trapframe/trampoline),
the physical page allocator, and page faults — with a parser for xv6's own `vmprint()` output, so
the VA reconstruction, the flag decoding, and the DemoVm feed are all unit-tested without QEMU.

    but `growproc` then grows sz UPWARD, so in this xv6 the heap lives ABOVE the stack, not

    `uvmclear` then clears ONLY `PTE_U`, so the guard is the single leaf below TRAPFRAME that is
    valid and NOT user — every other user-space page has U set. That signature does not move when
    sz does.

    `sz` remains an optional refinement: given it, the heap runs to the process's real break;
