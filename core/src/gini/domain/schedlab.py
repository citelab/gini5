"""The scheduler lab's engine: two threads, one atomic line per step, and every schedule.

T-Lab 02 ("You are the scheduler") is a simulator and not xv6, on purpose. The bug a concurrency
lab is about is the one schedule in twenty that loses an update, and a real kernel cannot be told
to take that schedule, cannot show the other nineteen, and cannot say "no schedule breaks this".
This module can: `step` moves time by exactly one line of one thread, `replay` turns a schedule into
the course notes' trace diagram, and `explore` walks every reachable state and either proves the
code or hands back the shortest schedule that breaks it.

It is a port of the reference engine the professor approved on the design mockup
(`docs/design/t-lab-02-reference/engine.js`), and the port is checked against it two ways: the
golden checks from that folder, and a fixture exported from the JavaScript for every level,
version and starting state (`tests/data/t-lab-02-engine_*.json`). Where the two engines disagree,
the JavaScript is what the professor saw; fix the port.

Pure, like the rest of `gini.domain`: no Qt, no I/O except reading a level file, and no
randomness ("Random" lives in the face). The purity is load-bearing rather than tidy. The
Teaching Center installs gini-core too, so it can replay a submitted schedule and re-explore a
submitted fix with this same code and confirm what the chain claims — a trace is a certificate
only because the thing that checks it has no Qt in it. Exploration is therefore deterministic:
the same code gives the same witnesses on every machine.

**A level is data.** The four levels ship as `tlabs/t-lab-02.yaml`; the loader at the bottom of
this module validates one and refuses, in one sentence each, anything that would not run. Later
T-Labs are new level files, not new code, so the loader is written as if three more are coming.

Two limits of this release, stated here because the engine does not enforce them everywhere it
could: levels have exactly two threads (the face has two lanes and a two-dimensional progress
graph), and each thread runs its lines once — there are no loops, because an unbounded loop is a
state space the explorer cannot finish.
