"""MachineState — the shared bridge between a running xv6 Machine and the rest of GINI.

Decision (signed off): the *state model* is the bridge, not the Machine Lab dialog. One
`MachineState` owns the provider, the latest `Snapshot`, the scheduling timeline, and a
`StateWatcher`; the Lab renders from it and the Ask GINI agent reads from it, so help works
whether or not the dialog is open and both sides see one atomic snapshot.

Everything here is pure (no Qt): the provider is injected (the offline `DemoScheduler` today,
a GDB bridge on the Mac later), so the serializer, the deltas, and the event watcher are all
unit-tested without QEMU.

  • `state_card(...)`   — a compact, progressive (L0/L1/L2) text block the agent is fed.
  • `StateWatcher`      — diffs successive snapshots into pedagogical events for Coach.
  • `MachineState`      — owns provider + timeline + watcher; refresh/step/controls + card().
