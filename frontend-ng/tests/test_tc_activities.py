"""Teaching Center activities: vending, deadlines, redemption, submission, privacy.

These are the rules a class depends on, so they are written as the things that must not happen:
a code issued after the deadline, a hoarded code still working, the same work handed in twice, a
student's identity landing in a table that promised not to hold one.

v1 has no observation plan, so nothing here mentions one. A code names an *activity*, and the
report narrates what the chain says happened. What is still enforced is integrity: the chain
verifies, and it was recorded under the code being redeemed.

No network, no model, no Docker. The store is a real SQLite database in a temp directory, because
the uniqueness constraints ARE the design and a mock would not have them.
