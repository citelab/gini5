"""Handing in: gBuilder uploads the runnable work, and a stolen file is worthless.

The whole point of the code is provenance. Everything here is one property, tested from both
sides:

    the chain is bound to the CODE          (verify_proof(expect_ticket=...))
    the chain commits to the TOPOLOGY       (submit entry carries sha256 of it)
    therefore the topology is bound to the code, and a classmate's project file
    cannot be handed in under your own.

Driven against a real server over a real socket, because that binding is only worth anything if
the server actually enforces it.
