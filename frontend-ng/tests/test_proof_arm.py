"""Arming a code: what the student is told they are recording for.

The server has always answered `check_code` with `activity` (which is `course/lab`), `title`,
`brief`, `session_minutes` and `valid_until`. The strip checked `ok` and discarded the rest — so a
student who pasted a code from their OTHER course armed silently, worked, and handed in there.
Correct, and invisible. These tests pin the two halves of the fix: say what was armed, and warn on
a mismatch without ever refusing one.
