"""The GINI Labs tab: what a student actually sees, and when.

Written as the states the panel has to get right, because every one of them is a moment where a
student could lose work or lose marks:

  * armed offline — it knows there ARE questions and has to say so, or a lab is handed in with
    blanks caused by hotel wifi and nobody finds out until it is marked;
  * mid-answer — a rebuild must never destroy the box someone is typing in;
  * handed in — the boxes have to go dead, because an answer past the `submit` entry is in a
    chain nobody reads again.
