"""First-run bootstrap: what the machine needs, and the one rule about architecture.

The rule worth defending: **an image reference must never name an architecture.** A multi-arch
manifest list means the REGISTRY resolves arm64 vs amd64 at pull time. Baking `-arm64` into a tag
would move that decision into the client, where it can be wrong — and the failure is silent, a
confident pull of binaries that will not run.

Everything here is Qt-free and network-free: `plan()` only looks at the machine, and `execute()`
takes its `run` injected.
