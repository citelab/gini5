"""A T-Lab trace is a certificate, and the Teaching Center checks it.

The scheduler lab runs in GINI's own simulator, and the engine is pure and ships in gini-core —
which this server depends on. So a `schedule` entry can be REPLAYED here, on the same level file,
and a `proved` entry's code can be explored again; the chain's claim either holds or it does not.
That is the property the professor most wanted from building the lab as a simulator rather than
on xv6, and these tests are it: a chain the lab produced re-checks, a chain somebody edited by
hand does not, and both are REPORTED beside the row — never refused, exactly as `check_sources`
treats a mismatched file.

The chains here are made by driving `sched_lab.Session` with its own event hook, so what the
server re-checks is what the client really records, not a hand-written imitation of it.
