"""The transcript an instructor actually reads.

(Named `test_proof_narration` because `tests/test_narration.py` already belongs to the *mission*
narrator in `agent/narration.py` — a different thing entirely, and one that must keep its name.)

The chain is the evidence; this is its reading, and the bar is "skimmable on a Sunday with thirty
of them to get through". So the tests here are mostly about *what a marker must not be able to
miss*: an import that did not happen here, elements the chain cannot account for, and the absence
of any live check. Nothing in the narration may say more than the entries support — if a sentence
cannot be pointed at an entry, it does not belong.
