"""The first-run panel, and what gets to interrupt a launch.

The rule this file defends: **setup comes before the tour.** They used to be two unconditional
timers 250ms apart — a modal `CueCards(...).exec()` at 450ms and a non-modal setup panel at 700ms
— so on the launch that mattered most, a brand-new install, "here are all the features" opened on
top of the one action that has to happen before any of those features work, and the panel
underneath it could not even be clicked. Nothing was broken; it was simply never seen.
