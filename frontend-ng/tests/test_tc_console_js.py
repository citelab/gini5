"""The console's JavaScript must actually parse.

Written after shipping a blank page. The Activities tab re-declared `esc`, which was already
defined a couple of hundred lines above; `const` twice at top level is a SyntaxError, and a
SyntaxError anywhere in a <script> block aborts the WHOLE block — so the sign-in gate never
rendered either and the console was blank. Every HTTP test still passed, because the server was
fine and the page was served with a 200.

That is the shape of the failure worth guarding: nothing on the Python side can see it, and status
codes cannot either. So parse the JavaScript, with a real parser when one is available.
