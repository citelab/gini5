"""The two distributions build, install cleanly, and stay apart.

The Teaching Center runs on a headless server VM. The trap this guards is that `gini-toolkit`
hard-depends on PySide6-Essentials + PySide6-Addons — Qt and a Chromium build — so a Teaching
Center that depended on the toolkit would drag several hundred MB onto a machine that never opens
a window, and would fail outright where PySide6 has no wheel.

`gini` is an implicit NAMESPACE package split across gini-core and gini-toolkit. Neither may ship
`gini/__init__.py`, or one distribution silently shadows the other's half of the tree.
