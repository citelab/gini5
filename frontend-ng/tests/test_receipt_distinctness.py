"""What a receipt code can and cannot detect.

The Teaching Center leans on two different collision checks to catch two different cheats, and the
whole design rests on knowing which catches which. That distinction was asserted in a spec on the
strength of a one-off run; these tests make it a property of the code instead.

The short version: a receipt catches a copied *file*; only the artifact hash catches copied *work*.
