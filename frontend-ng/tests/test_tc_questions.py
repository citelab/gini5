"""Lab questions: authored by the teacher, asked of the student, read by a marker.

The design in one line: the teacher writes several questions with the answers they expect, each
student is asked a random selection, the answers land in the proof chain, and a person marks them.

Everything below is a rule that design depends on, written as the thing that must not happen:

  * a student's machine receiving the answer key — from arming, or from Ask GINI;
  * the questions changing under a student between arming and finishing;
  * an unanswered question stopping them handing in;
  * a question a code was already asked disappearing when the teacher edits the set;
  * anything, anywhere, deciding that an answer is right or wrong.

That last one is the whole point. GINI does not mark; it records, and a teaching assistant reads.
