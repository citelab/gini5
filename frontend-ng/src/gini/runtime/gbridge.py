"""gbridge relay: attach real GINI32 (ESP32) boards to the emulated fabric.

A GINI32 board is a real radio sitting on the physical LAN; the fabric is a set of
UDP endpoints on Docker's `gini` bridge. The board cannot reach those endpoints
directly (router containers publish no ports, and on macOS Docker runs in a VM), and
the C gRouter only ever replies to the peer address it was configured with, so a
board on DHCP could not be addressed anyway.

This relay closes both gaps. It is one container on the `gini` network with ONE
published UDP port. Boards send to that port on the host's LAN address; the relay
learns each board's address from its own traffic and shuttles frames to the router
interface that the board's canvas element is wired to.

    phone --802.11--> [board: gBridge] --G32/UDP--> host:5555 --> [relay] --eth/UDP--> [gRouter tun]
                                        \\________ physical LAN ________/    \\__ docker gini net __/

Framing. On the *fabric* hop the payload is a bare Ethernet frame, exactly as every
other GINI link (see transport.Port) -- nothing here changes that contract. On the
*board* hop each datagram carries a fixed 24-byte header so that one published port
can serve many boards and so a board can announce itself before it has traffic:

    off 0  magic   3   b"G32"
    off 3  version 1   = 1
    off 4  type    1   HELLO | HELLO_ACK | FRAME | KEEPALIVE
    off 5  rsv     3   zero
    off 8  board   16  board id, NUL-padded ASCII
    off 24 payload ..  (FRAME: the Ethernet frame; HELLO: optional ASCII info)

Fixed offsets keep the ESP32 side trivial. The relay is deliberately permissive on
ingress (any source address may speak for a board it names) and strict on egress
(frames only go to a board that has checked in) -- the same asymmetry the gRouter's
own tun_recvfrom uses, for the same reason: boards move, and dropping on a mismatch
silently breaks the link.
