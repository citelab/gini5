"""OS HUD — the kernel as a map, with the story of one process underneath it.

TWO READINGS OF THE SAME TEN SECONDS, in one panel:

  BOARD    a permanent map of the kernel — twelve subsystem blocks, the three doors in, the
           device boundary, and the wide lane that never enters the kernel at all. Answers
           "what is the kernel made of, where is the CPU, what is expensive".
  X-RAY    the swimlanes below — individual events in exact kernel order, optionally focused on
           one pid. Answers "what happened, and in what order".

Neither substitutes for the other: the board can never say `exec` preceded the page fault, and
the X-ray can never say the block cache absorbed 589 of 601 requests. They share one window, one
history and one scrub timeline, which is precisely why they belong in one panel rather than two.

THE GEOMETRY IS THE ARGUMENT
----------------------------
An earlier version stacked user / kernel / hardware, which draws the lie students already
believe: that reaching the hardware means going THROUGH the kernel. It does not. If a process has
the CPU and its memory is mapped, it simply runs — ~10^8 instructions per second with no kernel
instruction executing. So the board has two lanes, and the kernel is off to one side, entered
only through three doors.

The dashed arrow is the deepest thing on it: the kernel writes satp and stvec, then steps aside.
It is not bypassed despite itself — it arranged to be bypassed. Drawn dashed because it is
CONFIGURATION, NOT A CALL.

Colour language, shared with the rest of the OS views:
    green  = user / the direct path        blue = kernel        amber = boundary (doors, drivers)

Encoding rule, and the reason the board is worth building: arrow width is CALLS, block shade is
CPU TIME. They disagree — bcache is asked ~50x more often than the disk and holds a fraction of
the time — and that disagreement is the difference between frequency and cost.

#                 board element.)
