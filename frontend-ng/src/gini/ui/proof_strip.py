"""The proof-of-activity control at the left of the dashboard strip.

States:

  * **unarmed** — a code box, and nothing else: no trace of whatever code was last recorded.
  * **armed** — a large ``● REC`` block, the code, the event counter, *Generate proof*, *Cancel*.
  * **sending** — the same, plus a progress bar while the package goes to the course server.

The recording indicator is the whole reason this lives on the always-visible strip rather than
behind a menu. A student must never do three hours of work and only then discover that nothing was
recorded, so the state is on screen the entire time and the event counter moves as they work. It is
deliberately loud: recording is a mode, and a mode you cannot see is a mode you forget you are in.

Recording used to be a one-way door. Nothing disarmed — not even generating a proof, which left the
strip saying "recording" for ever — so arming the wrong code meant restarting gBuilder. *Pause* was
the first fix and only half a departure: it kept the code on screen and offered it back on a
button, so the mode was left but not really exited. *Cancel* is the whole departure — the strip
goes back to a bare code box and says nothing about what was being recorded a moment ago.

Nothing is lost by cancelling. The chain lives on disk under its code, and typing that code again
appends to it, so a student never trades their morning's work for the ability to stop recording.
That is a property of `services.proof_recorder.arm`, not of this widget.

Work that has not reached the Teaching Center is shown here too, with how long it has been waiting
and what went wrong. The outbox has always recorded that; none of it ever reached the screen, so a
submission retried and refused eleven times looked exactly like one that had never been tried.

Thin by design: every decision belongs to `services.proof_recorder`, which is testable without Qt.
