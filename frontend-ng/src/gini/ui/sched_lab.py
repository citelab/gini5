"""T-Lab 02 — You are the scheduler. The face over `gini.domain.schedlab`.

The student is the scheduler: two threads, one atomic line per press, and a trace that is written
row for row the way the course notes draw it. Then "Try every schedule" and GINI runs every order
the scheduler could have picked and says what can happen — which is the thing no live kernel can
show, and why this lab is a simulator and not an xv6 face (see the engine's docstring).

Two halves, and the seam is the point:

* **The top half is a view model with no Qt in it.** `lane`, `trace_rows`, `state_rows`, `graph`,
  `results` and friends are pure functions from (level, code, a replay, an exploration) to what is
  drawn: which line is next, what each trace box says and what colour it is, where the staircase
  goes on the progress graph, which outcomes are possible. `Session` holds what the student has
  chosen — level, version, start, the schedule so far, the edited code in Fix it — and nothing
  else. Everything a behaviour test wants to assert is reachable here without a widget, in the
  same spirit as `lock_lab.bar_rows`.
* **The bottom half draws it.** One window, 940 × 700, the size the Machine Lab's own pages open
  at; the first, wide mockup was rejected for exactly this. The trace and the progress graph are
  painted (`_TraceView`, `_GraphView`): the mockup's grid of cells was a canvas workaround, not a
  design. The code tiles are real widgets because in Fix it they are buttons.

**Code sits on the trace.** The left panel is one four-column grid — row number, thread A, thread
B, shared state — and the trace rows use the SAME columns, so a box in the producer's column is
under the producer's code. The painted trace asks the lane widgets where they are rather than
guessing from stretch factors, which is what keeps the two aligned when a scrollbar appears.

**No worker thread, by design.** Exploring a shipped level visits a few dozen states and runs on
the GUI thread in well under a frame, so the hazard in known issue 17 (a fire-and-forget worker
emitting into a dialog being destroyed) cannot arise here. Keep it that way: if a later level ever
needs exploration off the GUI thread, read that issue first.

Colour is never the only signal. Every coloured trace row also carries words in the state column
("producer blocks", "P1 spins", ": both inside", ": deadlock"), every pinned tile says "pinned",
and every goal chip has its mark as text. The hues come from the notes' trace key on the Light
theme; on the dark themes they are mapped onto the theme's semantic tokens so the MEANINGS survive.
