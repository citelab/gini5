"""Shared live-poll behaviour for the Machine Lab's data faces.

The Virtual Memory and File System faces had no timer at all: they painted once in the
constructor and once per button press, so `alloc`, `toucher`, `writer` and `sgrind` — programs
written to be *watched* — were watched on a still photograph.

Every rule encoded here was learned the expensive way, and each one has a test:

  * **one read in flight at a time** — a slow round must not have another started on top of it
  * **stop on close, pause on hide** — a lab nobody is looking at must cost nothing
  * **read off the GUI thread, render on it** — Qt objects are touched only in the slot
  * **back off when the wire is busy** — the serial line is the scarce resource, not the CPU
  * **a bad read never blanks a good picture** — it marks it stale and keeps it

**The join in `stop_polling()` is the load-bearing part.** The first draft of this mixin fired
daemon threads and forgot them, guarding only with an `if not self._closed` before the emit. That
loses two ways. The test suite's autouse `_no_leaked_threads` fixture fails any test that leaves a
thread running, so every test with a deliberately slow provider would fail on the guard rather
than on its own assertion. Worse, in production `_retire` calls `close()` then `deleteLater()`
while a worker may already be *past* the flag check and about to emit into a QObject being
destroyed — which is exactly the shape that was crashing pytest-qt on half of all runs before the
runtime `stop()` work. So `_closed` is set BEFORE the timer stops, and the worker is joined: once
the flag is set no emit can happen, and the join only waits for the read itself to return.

The host class must declare `snap_ready = Signal(object)` and implement `_read()` (off the GUI
thread; return None to mean "this round failed") and `_render_live(payload, fresh)`.

**Use this rather than rolling your own worker.** Fire-and-forget `threading.Thread` in a QDialog,
guarded only by an `if not self._closed` before the emit, is a CLASS of crash in this codebase and
not a hypothetical: it took the Traps face down nondeterministically (SIGSEGV) until it was moved
onto this mixin. `docs/manual/os-15-known-issues.md` §17 has the mechanism, the proof, and a census
of the faces that still carry the pattern. A one-shot worker that may outlive a bounded join holds
a `weakref` to the dialog, never `self` — see `TrapLab._step`, the worked example of adopting this
after the fact.
