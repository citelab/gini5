"""Network HUD — a toggle-on model view of the whole network's AUTHENTIC forwarding state.

A gray/glass panel (meant for the upper-right corner of the canvas) drawing the network as a
node-and-stick diagram: a **circle** for an IP router, a **square** for an OpenFlow switch. Minimal
info in each node; **click** a node → highlight the forwarding it produces, built by walking real
next-hops and real flow rules in domain/routing_model.py — never a Dijkstra — with loops /
dead-ends / ECMP shown honestly; **hold** a node → its full routing table (router) or flow table
(switch). Edges carry the configured delay-VNF latency.

Tracing is the click because it is what the panel is FOR. It sat behind a 380 ms hold once, and an
unselected panel looked exactly like a dark network — silence either way — which cost a long live
debugging session before the panel was taught to say which it was.

Two things the picture is careful about:

**The mode follows the root.** Click a router and you get the L3 forwarding tree, switches
appearing inside it as transit. Click a switch and you get L2 reachability across its fabric.
A pure-SDN network has no routers to pick, so it always reads in L2.

**Colour says who decided.** A lit edge takes the colour of the node at its SOURCE: `computed` (the
theme accent) where a router's longest-prefix match chose the next hop, `programmed` (purple) where
an installed flow rule chose the egress port. So an L3 hop across an SDN segment changes colour at
the square, which is exactly where the kind of decision changes. Classic switches are deliberately
not nodes at all — their forwarding is self-learned, and there is no decision to inspect.

The widget is pure rendering over a `RoutingModel` + node positions; the live model is assembled by
`domain.routing_model.collect_network_data(...)` and handed in via `set_model`.
