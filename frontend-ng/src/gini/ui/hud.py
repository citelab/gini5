"""Shared HUD scaffolding — the parts every heads-up display needs.

Three HUDs already exist (routing, flow, multicast) and each hand-rolled the same skeleton: a
glass panel, a `_busy` flag, a poll timer, an off-GUI-thread worker, `show_topright`/`close`, and
a mutually-exclusive toolbar toggle. The OS HUD would be the fourth copy, so the skeleton lives
here instead.

`HudHistory` is the generalised form of the Network HUD's `RouteHistory`: a ring of snapshots
deduped by signature, so a state that has not changed costs nothing and every retained entry is a
real change. It is what makes a HUD replayable, which matters far more for the OS than for the
network — kernel events happen in microseconds, so "watch it live" is not an option and scrubbing
is the primary way to read them.

The existing three HUDs are deliberately NOT refactored onto this yet: they work, they have Qt
tests, and the refactor should land where those tests can be run.
