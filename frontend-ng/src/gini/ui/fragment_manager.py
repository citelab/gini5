"""Fragment Manager — teacher mode.

A narrow icon rail (List · Create · Edit · Delete) over the fragment editor. The editor authors a
fragment from the live canvas two ways:

  * **Record (scan mode)** — flip it on and BUILD on the canvas; each action becomes an ordered step
    (place → wire → group). Deletes are not auto-pruned — remove stray steps by hand.
  * **Read from canvas** — the one-shot fallback for a board you already built.

Steps are editable inline: per-row ▲▼ reorder, ✕ delete, and a clickable level chip (place → connect
→ group → live). Plus **Add a live check** (the L4 runtime probe the recorder can't see) and **Add a
fork** (the difficulty knob). Finalize validates + writes the stamped YAML to ~/.gini/content.

Non-modal (floats over gBuilder) so recording keeps the canvas interactive.

<h3>Fragment Manager</h3>
<p>A <b>fragment</b> is a certified building block. You author one on the canvas, prove it works on
the live stack, and the composer then builds bigger networks out of it — that's how a handful of
blocks turn into many experiments.</p>

<h4>Two kinds of fragment</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>▪ Terminal</b> — self-contained, no holes. A LAN (2 hosts + a switch) is one. It's a
<i>value</i>: it can be dropped into another fragment's slot.</li>
<li><b>◆ Non-terminal</b> — has one or more open <b>slots</b>, shown in the list as
<code>⟨nets ×2+⟩</code>. A router "over 2-or-more networks" is one. It's a <i>template</i>: it isn't
a real network until its slots are filled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of a terminal as a value and a non-terminal as a function:
<code>router-net(nets := cap-lan, N=4)</code> evaluates to a concrete 4-LAN network.</p>

<h4>The buttons</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Record</b> — turn it on and BUILD on the canvas; each action becomes a step.</li>
<li><b>Read canvas</b> — one-shot: derive steps from a board you already built.</li>
<li><b>Add dependency</b> — build ON another certified fragment. It loads as a <b>locked
scaffold</b> and becomes a <b>slot</b>; only your own delta is saved. Choose a floor of 2+ to make
the slot <i>repeatable</i> (the composer can then scale it to any N), and choose whether members
hub back to your delta or interconnect as peers (mesh / ring / line / star).</li>
<li><b>Add a live check</b> — an L4 runtime probe (e.g. "this host reaches that one"), which only a
running system can answer.</li>
<li><b>Certify</b> — grade this fragment on the LIVE stack. Takes ~5–10s: it starts any Sources and
Sinks, lets traffic accumulate, grades, then stops them.</li>
<li><b>Validate ×N</b> — a <b>TEST</b>, not a build: fill the slots with N providers, materialize
the whole topology, and grade it. It proves your pattern generalizes. <b>Nothing is saved</b> and
the result is thrown away.</li>
<li><b>Composer</b> (rail) — the opposite: build a concrete network from certified fragments and
<b>keep</b> it, saved as a new terminal block.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Ports · In and Out</h4>
<p>Attach a <b>Source</b> (Ping Probe, HTTP Probe…) or a <b>Sink</b> (Packet View, iPerf Server…) to
an element and it becomes an input/output <b>port</b>. A Sink's measurement can be turned into a
graded <b>output check</b> with <b>＋ check</b> — that's how you grade what the system <i>did</i>,
not just how it was wired. The <b>Contract</b> line (provides / requires) is derived automatically;
you never type capability roles.</p>

<h4>The steps list</h4>
<p>Each step has a coloured <b>level</b> chip — <b>L1</b> place, <b>L2</b> connect, <b>L3</b> group,
<b>L4</b> live — click it to change. The <b>☆/★</b> is the difficulty <i>pass</i>: 0 stars is the
base experiment, ★ steps switch on in later passes so a student walks the experiment
progressively. ▲▼ reorder, ✕ deletes.</p>

<h4>Certification — and why it matters</h4>
<p>The <b>✓</b> means the fragment was graded green against a running system. Only certified
fragments can fill a slot or be uploaded, because the composer builds on them blindly — a broken
block would poison every experiment made from it. Editing a fragment drops its ✓ until you
re-certify.</p>

<h4>Typical flow</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a terminal (e.g. a LAN) → Run → Certify → Save.</li>
<li>Create a non-terminal → <b>Add dependency</b> (the terminal, floor 2+) → build your delta →
add a live check → Run → Certify → Save.</li>
<li><b>Validate ×N</b> at a few values of N to prove the pattern scales.</li>
<li><b>Composer</b> to build and keep a concrete network, or <b>Upload</b> to the Teaching Center.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Two gotchas</h4>
<ul>
<li>Validate ×N <b>replaces the canvas</b>. Reopen the fragment from the list before composing
again — and Save is blocked while a validation instance is showing (it would overwrite your
authored pattern with the scaled copy).</li>
<li>A fragment can never fill <b>its own</b> slot (directly or in a cycle) — that would be a
grammar with no base case. Nesting <i>different</i> fragments (campus → site → LAN) is fine and is
exactly what recursion means here.</li>
</ul>
