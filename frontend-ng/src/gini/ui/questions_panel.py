"""GINI Labs — the lab, and its questions, answered where the work is happening.

A tab beside Inspector / Ask GINI / GINI Source / Terminal, because that is where a student already
is. The alternative was a web form on the Teaching Center, which would have meant leaving gBuilder
mid-lab, signing in to something (students have no account, by design), and producing an answer
with no connection at all to the work it is about.

Answers go into the **proof chain**, so they are part of the submission rather than beside it: one
artefact, one hash chain, one thing for a marker to read, and an answer that cannot be separated
from the lab it was given during.

Three things this panel deliberately does not do:

  * **It does not mark.** The key never crosses the wire — the Teaching Center strips it from the
    arm reply — so there is nothing here to compare against and no code that could start trying.
  * **It does not block.** An unanswered question is a fact about the attempt for the marker to
    see, not a gate on handing in. A student who ran out of time still submits their work.
  * **It does not lecture.** No countdown, no "2 questions remaining!" nag. A count on the tab and
    one beep when they arrive is the whole of the pressure it applies.

Live only while recording is in progress, which is the whole of its lifetime: before arming there
is no lab, and after handing in an answer would land past the `submit` entry, in a chain nobody
will read again. Both states say so rather than presenting a dead box.
