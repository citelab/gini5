"""Running slow work off the GUI thread, safely.

Two mechanisms, one subject. `WorkerHost` (rules 1-3) is the QThread + worker-QObject pair the
hardware dialogs use for serial work. `run_off_gui` (rule 4, at the foot of this file) is the
plain daemon thread every lab, HUD and dialog uses for a docker exec or an HTTP read. They share
a file because they share the failure: something outlives the widget that started it.

Rules 1-3 were extracted from board_dialog so that every hardware dialog shares ONE copy. They
are not stylistic — each one is a bug that aborted the whole process when it was found by running
the setup dialog headless, and re-deriving them per dialog is how they come back:

1. **Hold a Python reference to the worker AND the thread.** PySide does not keep a
   worker alive merely because a signal is connected to it, so a worker passed in as a
   temporary is collected the moment the call returns; the thread then sits in its event
   loop forever and nothing is ever emitted.
2. **Connect only to BOUND METHODS of the dialog, never to a closure.** A closure has no
   thread affinity, so Qt chooses a direct connection and the "off-thread" handler runs
   ON the worker thread, touching widgets from outside the GUI thread.
3. **Never parent the QThread to the dialog.** Serial work is slow — a board reboots when
   its port is opened — so the dialog can easily be closed mid-run; destroying a running
   QThread makes Qt abort. Unparented, the module registry holds it until it finishes.

A host must provide `_alive: bool` and a `_worker_failed(str)` slot.

# Rule 4, and the reason this section exists: a plain `threading.Thread` closure must never be
# the last owner of the widget it reports back to.
#
# Most background work in this app is not a WorkerHost QThread — it is the small, uniform
# `threading.Thread(target=work, daemon=True)` that every lab, HUD and dialog uses to keep a
# docker exec or an HTTP read off the GUI thread. That shape has one flaw, and it is not the
# `self._closed` check those closures all make. It is OWNERSHIP:
#
#     def work():
#         txt = self._src()          # `work` closes over self — a strong reference
#         if not self._closed:
#             self.ready.emit(txt)   # queued to the GUI thread; fine on its own
#     threading.Thread(target=work, daemon=True).start()
#
# A parentless dialog is owned by Python. Close it and drop the last GUI-side reference — which
# is exactly what happens when a lab window is replaced, or when a test function returns — and
# the only reference left is the one inside `work`. The widget's refcount then reaches zero when
# the WORKER THREAD's frame is torn down, so PySide destroys a QWidget off the GUI thread. Qt
# forbids that, and the symptom is a segfault somewhere else entirely: in the next
# `processEvents()`, in an unrelated test, at a different point on every run.
#
# Measured before the fix: a loop of 30 open/close cycles destroyed 30 of 30 widgets on a worker
# thread, 0 on the GUI thread.
#
# `_closed` cannot help — it is a Python attribute and still reads perfectly well after the C++
# object is gone. Nor can a weakref inside the closure, on its own: dereferencing it to emit
# re-creates a strong reference on the worker thread, and the same teardown can land there.
#
# So the fix is to give the GUI side an owner that outlives the worker. `run_off_gui` holds the
# widget in a module-level registry for the duration of the call, and the worker releases it by
# emitting to a singleton reaper that lives on the GUI thread. The worker drops its own reference
# BEFORE it asks for that release, so no interleaving leaves it holding the last one. The widget
# is then destroyed where every widget must be: on the GUI thread.
