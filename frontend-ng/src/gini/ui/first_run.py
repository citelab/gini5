"""The first-run panel: get this machine ready to run topologies.

Replaces the `gini-setup` command. The old design asked a student who had just installed the app to
discover and type a second command; the ones who did not got a gBuilder that opened, looked
healthy, and then could not start anything.

Three principles, each one a mistake this project has already made once:

* **Never block the launch.** The window opens first and this appears over it. Somebody with no
  network, on a train, still gets to build and read topologies.
* **Never freeze the GUI.** Pulling images is minutes of work, so it runs on a worker thread and
  reports back through a Signal — the same pattern as `proof_strip` and `fragment_manager`.
* **Ask once before a large download.** "Automatic" should not mean several GB arriving unannounced
  on someone's tethered phone connection. One button, then it remembers.
