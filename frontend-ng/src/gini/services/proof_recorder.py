"""The recorder: turns gBuilder's live signals into chain entries.

Sits between the app bus and `domain.proof`. It owns the armed/unarmed state, the caches that let
a *removal* still know what was removed, and the promise that recording can never take the app
down with it.

Deliberately free of Qt. It calls `signal.connect(handler)` on whatever bus it is handed and
touches nothing else, so the whole recorder — subscriptions included — is unit-testable against a
fake bus with no PySide6 installed. That is the same seam `services/probe_runner.py` uses for
Docker.

**Nothing here may raise into a bus handler.** An exception in a slot lands in the Qt event loop,
and a student who loses their session because the *provenance* feature threw is worse off than one
with no provenance at all. Every handler is guarded; a broken recorder degrades to a silent one
and says so once in the console.

**A recording is paused or finished, never cancelled.** Students asked to be able to stop in the
middle of a lab and carry on another day, and the chain always allowed it — it lives on disk under
its code, and arming the code again appends to it. What was missing was the word: the button said
*Cancel*, which to a student means "throw it away". So the two ways out of recording are now
`pause()`, which writes a `stopped` mark and keeps the code as a bookmark the strip offers back as
*Resume*, and `generate_proof()`, which hands the work in and CLOSES the code: a finished recording
cannot be reopened, and a student who wants to do the lab again needs a new code. A lab can be
declared *one sitting* by the teacher, in which case the arm reply says so and there is no Pause.

        than being fixed at three. A syscall assignment submitted through the shadow path alone
        arrives with three files the student never opened and none of the ten they did.

        Which assignment each machine was carrying is resolved inside `collect`, per machine,
        because arming is per machine: a topology with M1 on A-Lab 01 and M2 on A-Lab 02 hands in
        both, each attributed to the machine it came from.

        The key is still "shadows" on the wire because the server reads it, and because what it
        has always meant is "the student's kernel source". Filenames do not collide between the
        two — a shadow is gini_*.c and nothing else is.

        Never fatal, either half: a proof that could not be written is a failure, a proof whose
        sources could not be read is still a proof.
