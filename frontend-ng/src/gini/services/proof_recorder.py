"""The recorder: turns gBuilder's live signals into chain entries.

Sits between the app bus and `domain.proof`. It owns the armed/unarmed state, the caches that let
a *removal* still know what was removed, and the promise that recording can never take the app
down with it.

Deliberately free of Qt. It calls `signal.connect(handler)` on whatever bus it is handed and
touches nothing else, so the whole recorder — subscriptions included — is unit-testable against a
fake bus with no PySide6 installed. That is the same seam `services/probe_runner.py` uses for
Docker.

**Nothing here may raise into a bus handler.** An exception in a slot lands in the Qt event loop,
and a student who loses their session because the *provenance* feature threw is worse off than one
with no provenance at all. Every handler is guarded; a broken recorder degrades to a silent one
and says so once in the console.
