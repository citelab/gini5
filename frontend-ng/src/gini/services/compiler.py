"""RuntimeCompiler — lower a canvas Topology onto the portable user-space runtime.

Generalizes the hand-written R0 wiring to any topology:
  * classify devices (machine / switch / router / grouping),
  * find L2 broadcast domains (segments) and give each a subnet,
  * assign IPs, gateways, MACs, and per-endpoint UDP ports,
  * emit machine/switch/router specs that gini.runtime can run (in-process or Docker).

Cloud "grouping" devices (VPC, cloud-subnet, region, cluster, pod, instance-group) are
organizational in R0 and are skipped as runtime nodes (links touching them are
dropped, with a note). Cloud endpoints (instances, containers, LBs, …) run as machines.
(Plain IP subnets are NOT a device: each L2 broadcast domain is auto-assigned a /24.)

    `viewer` is the device this block is being written FOR, and it decides which address a
    multi-homed name resolves to. Resolution takes the first matching line, so with no viewer a
    router always answers with its first interface — telling a host on 10.0.2.0/24 that `R1` is
    `10.0.1.1`, an address on the far side of the router it is directly attached to. Given a
    viewer, the interface sharing a subnet with it comes first, so `ping R1` answers with the
    router's address ON YOUR OWN SEGMENT — which is both the useful answer and the one a real
    network gives. A device with nothing in common with the viewer keeps its first interface, so
    every name still resolves to something.

    A router has one address PER SUBNET it joins, and binding only the first left every other one
    nameless — including the address each host on those subnets uses as its DEFAULT GATEWAY. On a
    two-subnet lab, `10.0.2.1` had no name at all, and a student on 10.0.2.0/24 who resolved `R1`
    was handed `10.0.1.1`: an address on the far side of the router. It usually still answered,
    via the default route, which is what kept the gap hidden.

    The device name stays bound to its FIRST interface and stays FIRST in the file, so `ping R1`
    resolves exactly as it did before. Every further address gains an `R1-eth1` style name and
    carries the device name as an alias, so nothing in the topology is unnameable and any address
    reverse-resolves to something that says which interface it is.
