"""First-run bootstrap: work out what this machine still needs, and get it.

Replaces the separate `gini-setup` command. A student who has just run `pip install gini-toolkit`
should be able to type `gbuilder` and have it sort itself out, rather than hitting a second command
they were never told about — the failure mode being an app that opens, looks fine, and then cannot
run anything.

**Architecture is deliberately absent from the image references.** A multi-arch manifest list means
`ghcr.io/…/gini-xv6:6.1.0` resolves to arm64 on Apple Silicon and amd64 on a PC *at pull time*, by
the registry. Baking `-arm64` into a tag here would move that decision into the client, where it
can be wrong — a student on an unusual platform gets a confident pull of the wrong binaries rather
than an honest "no image for your architecture". `arch()` exists for the diagnostics line and for
nothing else, and a test enforces that.

Qt-free on purpose: every decision lives here so it can be tested without a display, and the UI
only has to run `plan()` and then `execute()` on a worker thread.
