"""gBuilder's link to the Teaching Center: check a code, and hand in the work.

Two calls, no account, no session. A student never signs in to the Teaching Center — a vended code
is the whole interaction — so this needs nothing but a URL.

Deliberately NOT `agent/teaching_center.py`. That client is the v0 shape: enrolment tokens, lesson
packs, profiles, DM channels. Every one of those endpoints is gone, and dragging a class full of
dead methods into the one path a student depends on at deadline time would make it harder to see
whether *this* works.

**What gets sent, and why it cannot be stolen.** The proof is the tamper-evident chain, recorded
under the student's code. The topology is the runnable package. They are bound together already:
the chain's `submit` entry carries `sha256` of the topology it was generated from, and the chain
itself is bound to the code. So a student who obtains a classmate's project file gains nothing —
their own chain commits to a different digest, and the server checks it.

Timeouts are short and failure is always a sentence, never an exception: this runs at the end of a
lab, on campus wifi, and a student staring at a frozen dialog cannot tell whether their work is
safe.
