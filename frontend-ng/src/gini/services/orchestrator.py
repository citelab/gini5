# Machine images: two TOOLKITS, and lean is the default.
#
# A Host is the most replicated container in GINI — a ten-node topology is ten of them — so its
# image size is multiplied by ten while a Grafana is multiplied by one. It was also, historically,
# our FATTEST image: python:3.12-slim plus bind9, postfix, ettercap, tshark, nmap, haproxy… every
# host carried a mail server and a DNS server it would never run. On a lab machine slimmer than a
# developer's, that is where "GINI is slow" comes from.
#
# So a Machine now picks a toolkit:
#   lean (DEFAULT) — Alpine + python3 + the tools a student actually types: ip, ping, traceroute,
#                    tcpdump, curl, dig, nc, socat, iperf3, nmap. ~10x smaller.
#   full           — the old Debian image, for the book experiments that genuinely need the heavy
#                    services (DNS with bind9, mail with postfix, ARP/DNS spoofing with ettercap).
#                    Those tools are Debian-shaped; this is not worth porting to musl.
#
# NOTE this is a different axis from the element's SIZE (S/M/L/XL), which sets the CPU cap and the
# cost multiplier. A lean host with an XL CPU cap is a perfectly sensible thing to want, so the two
# must not be conflated: size = how much it gets, toolkit = what's installed in it.
