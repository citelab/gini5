"""Submissions that have not reached the Teaching Center yet.

The hole this fills: gBuilder generates a proof, shows the student a receipt, and the upload fails
because the wifi dropped. The student walks away holding a receipt that is *correct* — the server
computes it from the proof's MAC exactly as gBuilder does — but the Teaching Center has never heard
of it. The teacher types it in and is told "no submission with that receipt", and the two of them
have no way to tell who is wrong.

So every submission is written here BEFORE it is attempted, and stays until the server has it.
gBuilder flushes the outbox on launch and whenever it next talks to the course server, so the usual
recovery is that the student reopens gBuilder on campus and it quietly catches up.

**Nothing is ever deleted because the server said no.** An entry leaves only when the work is
demonstrably at the far end — accepted, or refused as a duplicate, which means an earlier attempt
already landed. A refusal for any other reason keeps the entry with its last error, so a student
whose code expired overnight still has a complete package to hand a teacher rather than an
apology. These files are a few KB; a lost evening is not recoverable.

Deliberately Qt-free: this is where the decisions live, so they can be tested without a display,
and the UI layer only has to marshal the result back to the GUI thread.
