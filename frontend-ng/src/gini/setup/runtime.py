"""Container-runtime detection + per-OS install guidance.

The runtime can't be bundled, and it differs per OS (Colima is macOS/Linux only; Windows uses Docker
Desktop/Podman). We detect a working Docker-compatible CLI and, where we can, offer the auto-install
commands — but only after the user consents (we never silently run privileged installers).

Podman compatibility
--------------------
GINI talks to the container engine ONLY through the CLI — never through a socket, never through a
Python SDK. That makes engine support a pure string question: which binary sits at the front of
every ``subprocess.run`` call. The answer is resolved ONCE by ``detect_engine``, cached in the
module, and consumed everywhere through ``engine_cli()`` and ``compose_cli()``. No abstraction
layer, no strategy pattern — just a prefix list that is ``["docker"]`` on one machine and
``["podman"]`` on another.

The detection order is deliberate: Docker first, because it is the documented path for every
platform except the Trottier lab machines and similar Podman-only environments. When a machine has
BOTH, Docker wins — Podman's ``docker`` compatibility shim (``podman-docker``) makes this the same
either way, and if they genuinely coexist (rare), Docker is the one with known-good compose
support.
