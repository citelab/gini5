    The setup marker records what a pull REPORTED, and that is not the same as what Docker holds.
    Both failures this project has shipped wrote a marker saying the machine was ready over a
    machine that could not start anything — 6.0.0 pulled arm64-only images on an Intel Mac, and
    6.1.0 pulled successfully but left nothing under the names the runtime resolves — and nothing
    ever re-checked, so gBuilder reported READY for ever and the panel never came back.

    A marker is a cache. This is its invalidation: cheap, local, and the same question the
    orchestrator will ask at Run time.

    MISSING MEANS "NOT THE IMAGE THIS VERSION WANTS", not "no image of that name". The two are not
    the same, and taking them for the same hid a three-week regression: a machine that installed
    6.0.0 in August still had `gini-xv6:latest` pointing at 6.0.0's kernel, so every check said
    "present", `needs_update` believed a marker that claimed 6.6.0, and the panel never appeared.
    Six releases of kernel work never arrived, and the first thing loud enough to notice was the
    OS HUD reporting "this kernel has no board support" — during a class demo.

    `local_name()` throws the version away by design (the runtime resolves `gini-xv6:latest`, and
    the compose file names it that way), so the ONLY thing that can tell a current image from a
    stale one is its id. Compare ids.
