"""Activity codes: vending them, judging them, and accepting what comes back.

A student takes a code from a public page, works free-form in gBuilder against a frozen Activity
Observation Plan, and their proof is submitted automatically. This module holds the rules that make
that safe. The rules live here rather than in `store.py` or `server.py` so they can be tested with
no database, no HTTP and no model.

Three ideas carry the design.

**A code is a scope, not an identity.** Nothing about a student is recorded — not here, not in the
tables. Anti-sharing does not come from making codes scarce; a code alone is worthless, because a
proof is a *chain* recorded under it. Handing a friend your code gives them nothing.

**Vending closes, and codes expire.** The vending deadline is what prevents late submissions. On its
own it would not: a student could take ten codes on day one and use one the following week, so
gating issuance alone does not gate use. Every code therefore carries an absolute `valid_until` of
`vend_until + session_minutes`. Hoarding buys nothing, and a code taken one minute before close
still gets its full session.

**Two collision checks, catching two different cheats.** A receipt collision means the same proof
*file* was handed in twice. An artifact collision means the same *topology* was built under two
codes — the collusion case a receipt cannot see, because the chain binds the ticket and the
timestamps, so identical work under different codes produces different receipts (pinned by
`frontend-ng/tests/test_receipt_distinctness.py`). In v1 this pair IS the point: there is no
observation plan, so the report describes what happened and these two checks are what stop the same
work being handed in twice.
