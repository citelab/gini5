"""Activity codes: vending them, judging them, and accepting what comes back.

A student takes a code from a public page, works free-form in gBuilder against a frozen Activity
Observation Plan, and their proof is submitted automatically. This module holds the rules that make
that safe. The rules live here rather than in `store.py` or `server.py` so they can be tested with
no database, no HTTP and no model.

Three ideas carry the design.

**A code is a scope, not an identity.** Nothing about a student is recorded — not here, not in the
tables. Anti-sharing does not come from making codes scarce; a code alone is worthless, because a
proof is a *chain* recorded under it. Handing a friend your code gives them nothing.

**Vending closes, and codes expire.** The vending deadline is what prevents late submissions. On its
own it would not: a student could take ten codes on day one and use one the following week, so
gating issuance alone does not gate use. Every code therefore carries an absolute `valid_until` of
`vend_until + session_minutes`. Hoarding buys nothing, and a code taken one minute before close
still gets its full session.

**Two ways to run a lab, and the duration picks which.** With `session_minutes > 0` the lab is a
TIMED ATTEMPT: the student gets that long, and the last code out still gets its full window past
the deadline. With `session_minutes = 0` the lab has a FIXED HAND-IN TIME: `valid_until` is the
vending deadline exactly, so everyone is due at the same moment however early they started. Today
Wednesday 20:00, vending stops Thursday 21:00, duration 0 — a student starting now has until
Thursday 21:00. Zero is a real value here and is never defaulted away; see `session_minutes_for`.

**A lab is pausable unless the teacher says one sitting.** gBuilder lets a student pause a
recording and resume it later — the chain carries a `stopped` mark and a `resumed` one with the
length of the gap — and the arm reply tells gBuilder whether this lab allows it (`pausable`). The
server never refuses a resumed chain either way: a one-sitting lab done in three is REPORTED, with
the sittings counted, and the teacher weighs it. The only thing the flag changes here is what the
session window is measured against — recording time for a pausable lab, wall-clock for one sitting.

**Two collision checks, catching two different cheats.** A receipt collision means the same proof
*file* was handed in twice. An artifact collision means the same *topology* was built under two
codes — the collusion case a receipt cannot see, because the chain binds the ticket and the
timestamps, so identical work under different codes produces different receipts (pinned by
`frontend-ng/tests/test_receipt_distinctness.py`). In v1 this pair IS the point: there is no
observation plan, so the report describes what happened and these two checks are what stop the same
work being handed in twice.

    The chain has carried these since the probes and riders shipped — `measure` from a Source/Sink
    rider, `witness` from a behavioural probe, `objective` from an objective changing state — and
    the report has never had a section for them. They reached a teacher only as a clause inside
    the narration ("…3 measurement(s)"), which is prose to read rather than a result to check, and
    is why a networking lab's numbers were effectively invisible at marking time.

    ONE list across every kind of lab, deliberately. A C-Lab's throughput reading, a T-Lab's
    reachability verdict and an OS lab's kernel metric are the same thing to a marker — something
    GINI observed and stands behind — and three sections would make a teacher learn which lab
    produces which. The `kind` column says where a row came from for anyone who cares.

    IN CHAIN ORDER, and repeats are kept. A probe that failed and then passed is the story of the
    attempt; collapsing it to its last verdict would hide the work and flatter the student, and
    collapsing it to its first would do the opposite.

    Nothing here is scored. `ok` is what GINI observed, not a mark: whether three of five probes
    passing is a pass is the teacher's call, exactly as `check_sources` reports a mismatched file
    and refuses to draw a conclusion from it.
