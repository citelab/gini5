"""GINI Teaching Center — v1.

Four things and nothing else (TEACHING_CENTER_V1_SPEC.md):

    staff        the admin adds and removes teachers
    courses      several, in one portal; everything hangs off a course
    activities   labs: vend codes, gBuilder records the work, submit, read the report
    content      course materials a teacher uploads for students

**No AI.** No model client is imported and no outbound model call is made. That removes an entire
class of failure — "the model timed out", "the model chose badly" — from a system teachers depend
on at deadline time. There is also no observation plan: gBuilder records what the student DID and
the report narrates it, so the account is true by construction.

**No student accounts.** A vended code is the whole interaction. The portal never learns who did
the work; the teacher maps a receipt to a name in their own gradebook, which is the only place that
mapping is needed.

Run:  ./run.sh          (sets PYTHONPATH; gini.domain is a hard dependency)
