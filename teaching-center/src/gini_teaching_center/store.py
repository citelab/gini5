"""The Teaching Center's system of record — SQLite, behind one small data-access layer.

Why this exists: a flat-file store corrupts under concurrent writes. The server is threaded, so two
submissions landing at the same instant can interleave and truncate a file. For class data that
"cannot be lost" that is the real risk, and SQLite closes it: atomic transactions, durable WAL
writes, no torn files. It ships with Python, so there is nothing to deploy.

Everything goes through `Store`. The method surface is deliberately storage-shaped (get/put/list),
not SQL-shaped, so moving to Postgres later is a swap of this one file.

Concurrency: one connection, WAL mode, guarded by a re-entrant lock. Classroom scale does not need
a pool, and a single guarded connection is the simplest thing that is provably correct.

**v1 scope.** Staff, courses, activities (labs), and course materials. No lessons, no roster, no
messages, no AI — see TEACHING_CENTER_V1_SPEC.md. The previous, larger schema is in git history if
v2 needs it back.
